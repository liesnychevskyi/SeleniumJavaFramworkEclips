Testing Automation Test, Teslink
=========================================================================================||
Question #1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------||
Please write a test for google search. the test has the following steps:
1. navigate to https://www.google.com; make sure page is open
2. type hotelbeds into search text-box
3. click on the first auto-complete item in auto-complete panel

expected results: at least 5 results have hotelbeds.com domain in their links
test must have:

1. support for browsers: chrome, firefox, internet-explorer, edge, chrome-android,
safari-mac, safari-ios
2. use only ONE locator per element (i.e. one locator for text-box, one locator for
auto-complete, etc). this locator must work for all supported platform -
AVOID creating platform specific locators
3. do not use any Thread.Sleep
4. do not use loops
5. do not use 'if' statement
6. test pass if met conditions (>= 5)
7. test fails if not meeting conditions (<5)
=============================================================================================||
Question #2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------||
please write a date-picker handler to manipulate a date-picker controller based on user
input
component must have (assuming all locators are known)
1. only one public signature of: public void Pick(int numberOfDaysFromToday)
2. use only 3 locators to handle all possible cases (assume the date-picker is
already open)
3. component automatically moves date forward or backward when necessary
4. component automatically picks the correct date
5. component code will not exceed 60 lines of code

sample:
var datePicker = new DatePicker();
datePicker.Pick(90);
when executed, the sample above will move date forward for 3 months and pick the
relevant day of the month
=============================================================================================||
Question #3 - Java Specific

0. Assuming Appium client libraries are not compliant anymore with Selenium client
libraries, please answer the following questions - no need to write any code, just
describe the process if the implementation is possible

========== Answer
Yes it is possible with this library -- https://bonigarcia.github.io/selenium-jupiter/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

1. Is it possible to test mobile web application or mobile native applications using
Selenium client libraries? 
(assuming Appium server is functional and running as
node.js server)
